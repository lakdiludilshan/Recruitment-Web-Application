                NSBM Green University, the nation’s premier degree-awarding institute, is the first of
                its kind in South Asia. It is a government-owned self-financed institute that operates
                under the purview of the Ministry of Education. As a leading educational centre in the
                country, NSBM has evolved into becoming a highly responsible higher education
                institute that offers unique opportunities and holistic education on par with international
                standards while promoting sustainable living.
                NSBM offers a plethora of undergraduate and postgraduate degree programmes under
                five faculties: Business, Computing, Engineering, Science and Postgraduate &

                programmes recognised by the University Grants Commission and the Ministry of
                Higher Education or world-class international programmes conducted in affiliation with
                top-ranked foreign universities such as University of Plymouth, UK, and Victoria
                University, Australia.
                Focused on producing competent professionals and innovative entrepreneurs for the
                increasingly globalising world, NSBM nurtures its graduates to become productive

                design, Quantity Surveying, Law and Multimedia.
                Inspired by the vision of being Sri Lanka’s best-performing graduate school and being
                recognised internationally, NSBM currently achieves approximately 3000 new
                enrollments per year and houses above 11,000 students reading over 50 degree
                programmes under 4 faculties. Moreover, over the years, NSBM Green University has
                gifted the nation with 14,000+ graduates and has proved its global presence with an
                alumni network spread all across the world.
                Nestling on a 40-acre land amidst the greenery and serenity in Pitipana, Homagama,
                NSBM Green University, is an ultra-modern university complex constructed with stateof-the-art facilities and amenities that provides the perfect setting for high-quality
